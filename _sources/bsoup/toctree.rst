What is web scraping?
:::::::::::::::::::::

The internet is full of information people would like to collect. Copying and pasting it would take forever! In this ebook, we'll explore an easier way.

 *Web scraping* is the process of getting information from web pages with code.

How this ebook works
::::::::::::::::::::

.. admonition:: During this lesson, you will learn code plans used by *real professionals*.

   These plans represent the most common patterns in web scraping with the BeautifulSoup library. The plans in this ebook were created after an anaylsis of 100 web scraping files from `Github <https://github.com/search?l=Python&q=BeautifulSoup%28&type=Code>`_, as well as two interviews with people who use web scraping in their jobs.
