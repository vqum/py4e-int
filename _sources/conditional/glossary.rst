    Body
      The sequence of statements within a compound statement.

    Boolean Expression
      An expression whose value is either ``True`` or ``False``.

    Branch
      One of the alternative sequences of statements in a conditional statement.

    Chained Conditional
      A conditional statement with a series of alternative branches.

    Comparison Operator
      One of the operators that compares its operands: ``==``, ``!=``, ``>``,
      ``<``, ``>=``, and ``<=``.

    Conditional Statement
      A statement that controls the flow of execution depending on some condition.

    Condition
      The boolean expression in a conditional statement that determines which
      branch is executed.

    Compound Statement
      A statement that consists of a header and a body. The header ends with a
      colon (:). The body is indented relative to the header.

    Guardian Pattern
      Where we construct a logical expression with additional comparisons to
      take advantage of the short-circuit behavior.

    Logical Operator
      One of the operators that combines boolean expressions: ``and``, ``or``,
      and ``not``.

    Nested Conditional
      A conditional statement that appears in one of the branches of another
      conditional statement.

    Traceback
      A list of the functions that are executing, printed when an exception occurs.

    Short Circuit
      When Python is part-way through evaluating a logical expression and stops
      the evaluation because Python knows the final value for the expression
      without needing to evaluate the rest of the expression.
