HUM00253102: Overcoming Barriers to Adoption of Peer Instruction in Undergraduate CS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Principal Investigator: Barbara Ericson

You are invited to participate in a research study about the effect of a tool to support Peer
Instruction on students and instructors. In Peer Instruction an instructor displays a hard
question, students answer individually, discuss their answer with one or more peers, and
then answer again. The instructor then reviews the question and discusses the answers.

Description of Procedures: If you agree to be part of this study, your answers to Peer
Instruction questions will be analyzed and we will record your demographic data, grades on
midterms, and your final grade. You will also be asked to fill out a survey and may be asked
to take part in an interview. Your participation will not affect your grade in any way.

Compensation: You will receive a $20 gift card if you participate in a one hour interview.
Benefits of the Research: This research will inform the design of a tool to support Peer
Instruction. This could result in improved student motivation and learning.
Risks and Discomforts: This study is expected to involve minimal risk. The risks involved are
no greater than those involved in existing daily practices, such as answering questions,
taking surveys, and using video conferencing software. However, a breach of confidentiality
is a risk common to this type of research. Safeguards to minimize this risk include replacing
your identifiable information (name or username) with a code before data is analyzed. The
document that links the codes to your name or username will be encrypted and stored on a
password protected system. The interviews will be recorded, but any identifiers will be
removed from the transcript and replaced with a code. The document that links your identify
to the code will be stored on a password protected system.

Confidentiality: Your privacy will be protected and research records will be confidential. Only
researchers will have access to your data and that data will be stored on a password
protected system. All identifiable information (name/username) will be replaced with a code
before the data is analyzed. The document that links the code to your name/username will
be encrypted and stored on a password protected system.

Storage and Future Use of Data: All identifiable data will be destroyed five years after we
stop gathering data for this study and have disseminated the findings from the research.
Information collected in this project may be shared with other researchers, but we will not
share any information that could identify you.

Voluntary Nature of the Study: Participating in this study is completely voluntary. Even if you
decide to participate now, you may change your mind and stop at any time. You may choose
not to answer any survey question or continue with the interview for any reason.
