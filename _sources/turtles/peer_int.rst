    :answer_a: Draw nothing
    :answer_b: Draw a line
    :answer_c: Draw a triangle
    :answer_d: Draw a line with a pointy bit
    :answer_e: I don't know
    :correct: b
    :feedback_a: Try again. We need to draw something to start. And a flat line will be the base case in our recursive function.
    :feedback_b: Correct! A flat line will be the base case in our recursive function.
    :feedback_c: Try again. What does a triangle consist of? A flat line right?
    :feedback_d: Try again. No pointy bit is necessary here. A flat line will be the base case in our recursive function.
    :feedback_e: Try again. A flat line will be the base case in our recursive function.

    What is the base case to create a snowflake through a recursive function?

    :answer_a: 1/3 w
    :answer_b: 1/2 w
    :answer_c: 2/3 w
    :answer_d: w
    :answer_e: I don't know
    :correct: c
    :feedback_a: Try again. we trisect the flat line, and inserting into the middle portion two lines joined at an acute angle. The length of each of the new lines is 1/3 of the total length of order. Therefore, the rest of line should be 2/3 width.
    :feedback_b: Try again. we trisect the flat line, and inserting into the middle portion two lines joined at an acute angle. The length of each of the new lines is 1/3 of the total length of order. Therefore, the rest of line should be 2/3 width.
    :feedback_c: Correct! The length of each of the new lines is 1/3 of the total length of order. Therefore, the rest of line should be 2/3 width.
    :feedback_d: Try again. we trisect the flat line, and inserting into the middle portion two lines joined at an acute angle. The length of each of the new lines is 1/3 of the total length of order. Therefore, the rest of line should be 2/3 width.
    :feedback_e: Try again. we trisect the flat line, and inserting into the middle portion two lines joined at an acute angle. The length of each of the new lines is 1/3 of the total length of order. Therefore, the rest of line should be 2/3 width.

    How long will my line be in of width?

    :correct: c
    :feedback_a: Try again. The new pattern draws an equilateral triangle on each middle part of the original triangle. And each part of the original triantgle is split into 4 parts.
    :feedback_b: Try again. The new pattern draws an equilateral triangle on each middle part of the original triangle. And each part of the original triantgle is split into 4 parts.
    :feedback_c: Correct! Each part of the original triantgle is split into 4 parts.
    :feedback_d: Try again. The new pattern draws an equilateral triangle on each middle part of the original triangle. And each part of the original triantgle is split into 4 parts.
    :feedback_e: Try again. The new pattern draws an equilateral triangle on each middle part of the original triangle. And each part of the original triantgle is split into 4 parts.
