Study Information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hi, we are a team of researchers in Professor Ericsonâ€™s Lab at UMSI. You are invited to participate in a study to help CS entry-level learning (UM IRB HUM00253438). 
Your participation will help more novice programmers become successful in introductory computing courses in a low-cost, scalable, and easily adopted way.

This study has four parts. It will take approximately 40 minutes to complete it.  
Please do the parts in order and answer questions to the best of your ability without any outside help including ChatGPT. 
Please do the parts by yourself. You can stop working on a problem after you worked on it for about eight attempts without solving it.

The four parts are:

- **Know about your current state** - A survey about your self-efficacy on computer science + 4 self-evaluation survey questions.
- **Introduction to the Practice Types** - A brief overview of the practice types.
- **Practice** - Complete four mixed-up puzzle pairs, followed by survey questions.
- **Posttest** - Includes 10 multiple-choice / true-false / short-answer questions.

Only your anonymous log fles from this session will be used for this study. No identifiable information will be collected. You will not be graded on your performance.

If you have questions at any time about the study or the procedures, you may contact the researcher at email xyhou@umich.edu.
