   :practice: T
   :answer_a: Ints only have 2 decimal places
   :answer_b: Ints don’t have any decimals
   :answer_c: It’s easier to multiply ints
   :answer_d: Funsies
   :answer_e: I don't know
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Try again. Ints do not b have any decimal places.
   :feedback_b: Correct! Because ints do not have any decimal places,therefore by multipling it with 100, the two decimal places can be transformed into ones and tens place. 
   :feedback_c: Try again. Try to consider why we multiply the number by 100. Becausen we want the two decimal places to be transformed into ones and tens place. 	:feedback_d: Try again. Good point but we want the funsies?
   :feedback_e: Try again. Try to consider why we multiply the number by 100. Because ints do not have any decimal places,therefore by multipling it with 100, the two decimal places can be transformed into ones and tens place.
 
 
   Recall that when we wanted to cut off all but two decimal places of a float, we multiplied it by 100, cast it as a integer, and then divided it by 100 using float division. Why did we cast it as an int?
