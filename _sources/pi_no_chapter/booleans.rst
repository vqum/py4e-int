   :practice: T
   :answer_a: Only (7>2)
   :answer_b: Only (9<2)
   :answer_c: Only (8>3)
   :answer_d: (7>2) and (8>3)
   :answer_e: All the code is evaluated
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Correct! When an expression contains 'and' or 'or', Python evaluates from left to right. If the first part of an expression containing 'or' is True, it stops validating as the truth of the statement is know. This option is correct as (7>2) is True and the expression contains 'or'. 
   :feedback_b: Incorrect! When an expression contains 'and' or 'or', Python evaluates from left to right. If the first part of an expression containing 'or' is True, it stops validating as the truth of the statement is know. This option is correct as (7>2) is True and the expression contains 'or'. So, there's no need to evaluate other parts of the expression.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect! When an expression contains 'and' or 'or', Python evaluates from left to right. If the first part of an expression containing 'or' is True, it stops validating as the truth of the statement is know. This option is correct as (7>2) is True and the expression contains 'or'. So, there's no need to evaluate other parts of the expression.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect! When an expression contains 'and' or 'or', Python evaluates from left to right. If the first part of an expression containing 'or' is True, it stops validating as the truth of the statement is know. This option is correct as (7>2) is True and the expression contains 'or'. So, there's no need to evaluate other parts of the expression.
   :feedback_e: Incorrect! When an expression contains 'and' or 'or', Python evaluates from left to right. If the first part of an expression containing 'or' is True, it stops validating as the truth of the statement is know. This option is correct as (7>2) is True and the expression contains 'or'. So, there's no need to evaluate other parts of the expression.

   :feedback_a: Incorrect! When an expression contains 'and' or 'or', Python evaluates from left to right. It stops evaluating once the truth value of the expression is
known. Here, the truth is not established until all parts of the expressions have been evaluated.
   :feedback_b: Incorrect! When an expression contains 'and' or 'or', Python evaluates from left to right. It stops evaluating once the truth value of the expression is
known. Here, the truth is not established until all parts of the expressions have been evaluated.
   :feedback_c: Incorrect! When an expression contains 'and' or 'or', Python evaluates from left to right. It stops evaluating once the truth value of the expression is
known. Here, the truth is not established until all parts of the expressions have been evaluated.
   :feedback_d: Incorrect! When an expression contains 'and' or 'or', Python evaluates from left to right. It stops evaluating once the truth value of the expression is
known. Here, the truth is not established until all parts of the expressions have been evaluated.
   :feedback_e: Correct! When an expression contains 'and' or 'or', Python evaluates from left to right. It stops evaluating once the truth value of the expression is
known. Here, the truth is not established until all parts of the expressions have been evaluated.
