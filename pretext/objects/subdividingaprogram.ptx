  <title>Subdividing a problem</title>
  <p>One of the advantages of the object-oriented approach is that it can
            hide complexity. For example, while we need to know how to use the
            <c>urllib</c> and BeautifulSoup code, we do not need to know how those libraries
            work internally. This allows us to focus on the part of the problem we need to
            solve and ignore the other parts of the program.</p>

      <p>Q-1: One of the advantages of the __________ approach is that it can hide complexity. <var/>  </p>
    </statement>
    <setup>
      <var>
        <condition string="[Oo]bject[-\s+][Oo]riented">
          <feedback>
            <p>Yes, we do not need to know how the object classes
work internally when we use them.</p>
          </feedback>
        </condition>
        <condition string=".*">
          <feedback>
            <p>Try again!</p>
          </feedback>
        </condition>
      </var>
    </setup>
  </exercise>
  <p>This ability to focus exclusively on the part of a program that we care about
            and ignore the rest is also helpful to the developers of the objects that we use.
            For example, the programmers developing BeautifulSoup do not need to
            know or care about how we retrieve our HTML page, what parts we want to
            read, or what we plan to do with the data we extract from the web page.</p>
