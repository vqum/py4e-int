  <title>Image Chaper Summary</title>
  <p>This chapter included the following concepts from computing.</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><term>Class</term> - We worked with the Image and Pixel classes.  An image object has pixel objects.  Each pixel object has a color which is made up of red, green, and blue values.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><term>For Loop</term> - A <c>for</c> loop is a programming statement that tells the computer to repeat a statement or a set of statements (<term>which are the body of the loop</term>). It will repeat a specific number of times.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><term>Image</term> - An object that represents an image or picture on a computer.  An image has pixels arranged in a rectangular block.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><term>Loop Body</term> - The statement or statements that are repeated in a loop.  In Python indention is used to show what statements are part of the body of a loop.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><term>Nested Loop</term> - A nested loop has one loop inside the body of another loop.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><term>Pixel</term> - A pixel is one small part (element) of an image (picture).  Pixels are stored in a grid and have both a x (horizontal) and y (vertical) value.  A pixel has a color which can be defined by an amount of red, green, and blue with values from 0 to 255.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
