  <introduction>
  <p>This chapter included the following concepts from computing.</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><term>Body Syntonic</term> - Body syntonic means experiences related to knowledge of your body.  You can use your knowledge of how to move your body to help you understand how to move the turtle objects.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><term>Comment</term> - A comment describes one or more lines of code.  Comments are ignored by the computer.  A comment in Python starts with <c>#</c>.  The computer will ignore everything from the start of the comment to the end of that line.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><term>Object</term> - Turtles are objects in Python.  Objects can have data and behavior.  A turtle object knows its heading (data) and can go forward and turn (behavior).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><term>Method</term> - Functions that are defined in the Turtle class are called methods.  Methods define the behaviors for the objects of a class (what they can do).</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
