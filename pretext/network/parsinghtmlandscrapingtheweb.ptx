  <title>Parsing HTML and scraping the web</title>
  <p>One of the common uses of the <c>urllib</c> capability in Python
            is to <em>scrape</em> the web. Web scraping is when we write a
            program that pretends to be a web browser and retrieves pages, then
            examines the data in those pages looking for patterns.</p>
  <p>As an example, a search engine such as Google will look at the source of
            one web page and extract the links to other pages and retrieve those
            pages, extracting links, and so on. Using this technique, Google
            <em>spiders</em> its way through nearly all of the pages on the
            web.</p>
  <p>Google also uses the frequency of links from pages it finds to a
            particular page as one measure of how <q>important</q> a page is and how high
            the page should appear in its search results.</p>
