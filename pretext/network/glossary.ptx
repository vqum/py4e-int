      <title>BeautifulSoup</title>
      <p>A Python library for parsing HTML documents and extracting data from
                            HTML documents that compensates for most of the imperfections in the
                            HTML that browsers generally ignore. You can download the
                            BeautifulSoup code from <url href="http://www.crummy.com" visual="http://www.crummy.com">www.crummy.com</url>.</p>

      <title>Port</title>
      <p>A number that generally indicates which application you are
                            contacting when you make a socket connection to a server. As an
                            example, web traffic usually uses port 80 while email traffic uses
                            port 25.</p>

      <title>Scrape</title>
      <p>When a program pretends to be a web browser and retrieves a web
                            page, then looks at the web page content. Often programs are
                            following the links in one page to find the next page so they can
                            traverse a network of pages or a social network.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>Socket</title>
      <p>A network connection between two applications where the applications
                            can send and receive data in either direction.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>Spider</title>
      <p>The act of a web search engine retrieving a page and then all the
                            pages linked from a page and so on until they have nearly all of the
                            pages on the Internet which they use to build their search index.</p>
