  <p>Before we start learning the language we speak to give instructions to
            computers to develop software, we need to learn a small amount about how
            computers are built. If you were to take apart your computer or cell
            phone and look deep inside, you would find the following parts:</p>

  </figure>
  <p>The high-level definitions of these parts are as follows:</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The <em>Central Processing Unit</em> (or CPU) is the part of
                    the computer that is built to be obsessed with <q>what is next?</q> If
                    your computer is rated at 3.0 Gigahertz, it means that the CPU will
                    ask <q>What next?</q> three billion times per second. You are going to
                    have to learn how to talk fast to keep up with the CPU.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The <em>Main Memory</em> is used to store information that
                    the CPU needs in a hurry. The main memory is nearly as fast as the
                    CPU. But the information stored in the main memory vanishes when the
                    computer is turned off.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The <em>Secondary Memory</em> is also used to store
                    information, but it is much slower than the main memory. The
                    advantage of the secondary memory is that it can store information
                    even when there is no power to the computer. Examples of secondary
                    memory are disk drives or flash memory (typically found in USB
                    sticks and portable music players).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The <em>Input and Output Devices</em> are simply our screen,
                    keyboard, mouse, microphone, speaker, touchpad, etc. They are all of
                    the ways we interact with the computer.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>These days, most computers also have a <em>Network
                        Connection</em> to retrieve information over a network. We can
                    think of the network as a very slow place to store and retrieve data
                    that might not always be <q>up</q>. So in a sense, the network is a
                    slower and at times unreliable form of <em>Secondary
                        Memory</em>.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

  <p>While most of the detail of how these components work is best left to
            computer builders, it helps to have some terminology so we can talk
            about these different parts as we write our programs.</p>
  <p>As a programmer, your job is to use and orchestrate each of these
            resources to solve the problem that you need to solve and analyze the
            data you get from the solution. As a programmer you will mostly be
            <q>talking</q> to the CPU and telling it what to do next. Sometimes you will
            tell the CPU to use the main memory, secondary memory, network, or the
            input/output devices.</p>

  </figure>
  <p>You need to be the person who answers the CPU's <q>What next?</q> question.
            But it would be very uncomfortable to shrink you down to 5mm tall and
            insert you into the computer just so you could issue a command three
            billion times per second. So instead, you must write down your
            instructions in advance. We call these stored instructions a
            <em>program</em> and the act of writing these instructions down
            and getting the instructions to be correct <em>programming</em>.</p>
