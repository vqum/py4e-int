  <title>The learning journey</title>
  <p>As you progress through the rest of the book, don't be afraid if the
            concepts don't seem to fit together well the first time. When you were
            learning to speak, it was not a problem for your first few years that
            you just made cute gurgling noises. And it was OK if it took six months
            for you to move from simple vocabulary to simple sentences and took 5-6
            more years to move from sentences to paragraphs, and a few more years to
            be able to write an interesting complete short story on your own.</p>
  <p>We want you to learn Python much more rapidly, so we teach it all at the
            same time over the next few chapters. But it is like learning a new
            language that takes time to absorb and understand before it feels
            natural. That leads to some confusion as we visit and revisit topics to
            try to get you to see the big picture while we are defining the tiny
            fragments that make up that big picture. While the book is written
            linearly, and if you are taking a course it will progress in a linear
            fashion, don't hesitate to be very nonlinear in how you approach the
            material. Look forwards and backwards and read with a light touch. By
            skimming more advanced material without fully understanding the details,
            you can get a better understanding of the <q>why?</q> of programming. By
            reviewing previous material and even redoing earlier exercises, you will
            realize that you actually learned a lot of material even if the material
            you are currently staring at seems a bit impenetrable.</p>
  <p>Usually when you are learning your first programming language, there are
            a few wonderful <q>Ah Hah!</q> moments where you can look up from pounding
            away at some rock with a hammer and chisel and step away and see that
            you are indeed building a beautiful sculpture.</p>
  <p>If something seems particularly hard, there is usually no value in
            staying up all night and staring at it. Take a break, take a nap, have a
            snack, explain what you are having a problem with to someone (or perhaps
            your dog), and then come back to it with fresh eyes. I assure you that
            once you learn the programming concepts in the book you will look back
            and see that it was all really easy and elegant and it simply took you a
            bit of time to absorb it.</p>
