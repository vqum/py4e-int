  <title>Creativity and motivation</title>
  <p>While this book is not intended for professional programmers,
            professional programming can be a very rewarding job both financially
            and personally. Building useful, elegant, and clever programs for others
            to use is a very creative activity. Your computer or Personal Digital
            Assistant (PDA) usually contains many different programs from many
            different groups of programmers, each competing for your attention and
            interest. They try their best to meet your needs and give you a great
            user experience in the process. In some situations, when you choose a
            piece of software, the programmers are directly compensated because of
            your choice.</p>
  <p>If we think of programs as the creative output of groups of programmers,
            perhaps the following figure is a more sensible version of our PDA:</p>

  <p>For now, our primary motivation is not to make money or please end
            users, but instead for us to be more productive in handling the data and
            information that we will encounter in our lives. When you first start,
            you will be both the programmer and the end user of your programs. As
            you gain skill as a programmer and programming feels more creative to
            you, your thoughts may turn toward developing programs for others.</p>
