      <title>Attribute</title>
      <p>One of the values within a tuple. More commonly called a <q>column</q> or <q>field</q>.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>Constraint</title>
      <p>When we tell the database to enforce a rule on a field or a row in a table.
                            A common constraint is to insist that there can be no duplicate values in a
                            particular field (i.e., all the values must be unique).</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>Cursor</title>
      <p>A cursor allows you to execute SQL commands in a database and retrieve data
                            from the database. A cursor is similar to a socket or file handle for network
                            connections and files, respectively.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>Database Browser</title>
      <p>A piece of software that allows you to directly connect to a database and
                            manipulate the database directly without writing a program.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>Foreign Key</title>
      <p>A numeric key that points to the primary key of a row in another table. Foreign
                            keys establish relationships between rows stored in different tables.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>Database Index</title>
      <p>Additional data that the database software maintains as rows and inserts into
                            a tables to make lookups very fast.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>Logical Key</title>
      <p>A key that the <q>outside world</q> uses to look up a particular row. For example
                            in a table of user accounts, a person's email address might be a good candidate
                            as the logical key for the user's data.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>Normalization</title>
      <p>Designing a data model so that no data is replicated. We store each item of data
                            at one place in the database and reference it elsewhere using a foreign key.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>Primary Key</title>
      <p>A numeric key assigned to each row that is used to refer to one row in a table
                            from another table. Often the database is configured to automatically assign
                            primary keys as rows are inserted.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>Relation</title>
      <p>An area within a database that contains tuples and attributes. More
                            typically called a <q>table</q>.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>Database Tuple</title>
      <p>A single entry in a database table that is a set of attributes. More typically
                            called a <q>row</q>.</p>
