  <p>We will now redo the Twitter spider program using two tables, the
            primary keys, and the key references as described above. Here is the
            code for the new version of the program:</p>
  <pre>import json
import sqlite3
import twitter_info
import tweepy
import os

# Set up OAuth2 for access to twitter
auth = tweepy.OAuth2BearerHandler(twitter_info.bearer_token)
api = tweepy.API(auth, wait_on_rate_limit=True)

# set up the database tables
dir = os.path.dirname(__file__) + os.sep
conn = sqlite3.connect(dir + 'friends.db')
cur = conn.cursor()
cur.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS People
           (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT UNIQUE, retrieved INTEGER)''')
cur.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Follows
           (from_id INTEGER, to_id INTEGER, UNIQUE(from_id, to_id))''')

# Loop till the user enters quit
while True:
    acct = input('Enter a Twitter screen name, or hit enter, or type quit: ')
    if (acct == 'quit'): break # user entered quit, so stop
    if (len(acct) &lt; 1): # user hit enter, pick someone to visit

        # select a screen name that hasn't been visited yet
        cur.execute('SELECT id, name FROM People WHERE retrieved = 0 LIMIT 1')
        try:
            (id, acct) = cur.fetchone()
        except:
            print('No unretrieved Twitter accounts found')
            continue

    # See if the screen name (acct) is in the database
    cur.execute('SELECT id FROM People WHERE name = ? LIMIT 1',
               (acct, ))
    try:
        # it is so get the key (id)
        id = cur.fetchone()[0]
    except:
        # not there so add it
        cur.execute('''INSERT OR IGNORE INTO People
                   (name, retrieved) VALUES (?, 0)''', (acct, ))
        conn.commit()
        if cur.rowcount != 1:
            print('Error inserting account:', acct)
            continue
        id = cur.lastrowid

    print('Retrieving account', acct)

    try:
        idList = api.get_friend_ids(screen_name=acct)

    except Exception as err:
        print('Failed to Retrieve', err)
        break

    # Update the database to show that we have retrieved
    cur.execute('UPDATE People SET retrieved=1 WHERE name = ?', (acct, ))

    # loop through the idList
    countnew = 0
    countold = 0
    highest = min(len(idList), 5) # in case have less than 5 friends
    for i in range(highest):
        currId = idList[i]
        friend = api.get_user(user_id=currId)
        screenName = friend.screen_name

        # get the key for this screen name
        cur.execute('SELECT id FROM People WHERE name = ? LIMIT 1',
                   (screenName, ))

        # if found it then add one to count old
        try:
            friend_id = cur.fetchone()[0]
            countold = countold + 1

        # if didn't find it insert it
        except:
            cur.execute('''INSERT OR IGNORE INTO People (name, retrieved)
                        VALUES (?, 0)''', (screenName, ))
            conn.commit()
            if cur.rowcount != 1:
                print('Error inserting account:', screenName)
                continue
            friend_id = cur.lastrowid
            countnew = countnew + 1
        cur.execute('''INSERT OR IGNORE INTO Follows (from_id, to_id)
                    VALUES (?, ?)''', (id, friend_id))
    print('New accounts=', countnew, ' revisited=', countold)
    conn.commit()
cur.close()</pre>
  <p>This program is starting to get a bit complicated, but it illustrates
            the patterns that we need to use when we are using integer keys to link
            tables. The basic patterns are:</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Create tables with primary keys and constraints.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>When we have a logical key for a person (i.e., account name) and we need the
                    <c>id</c> value for the person, depending on whether or not the person is already
                    in the <c>People</c> table we either need to: (1) look up the person in the <c>People</c>
                    table and retrieve the <c>id</c> value for the person or (2) add the person to the
                    <c>People</c> table and get the <c>id</c> value for the newly added row.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Insert the row that captures the <q>follows</q> relationship.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>We will cover each of these in turn.</p>

  <subsection xml:id="database_constraints-in-database-tables">
    <title>Constraints in database tables</title>
    <p>As we design our table structures, we can tell the database system that
                we would like it to enforce a few rules on us. These rules help us from
                making mistakes and introducing incorrect data into out tables. When we
                create our tables:</p>
    <program language="python">
      <input>
cur.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS People
    (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT UNIQUE, retrieved INTEGER)''')
cur.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Follows
    (from_id INTEGER, to_id INTEGER, UNIQUE(from_id, to_id))''')
</input>
    </program>
    <p>We indicate that the <c>name</c> column in the <c>People</c>
                table must be <c>UNIQUE</c>. We also indicate that the combination
                of the two numbers in each row of the <c>Follows</c> table must be
                unique. These constraints keep us from making mistakes such as adding
                the same relationship more than once.</p>
    <p>We can take advantage of these constraints in the following code:</p>
    <program language="python">
      <input>
cur.execute('''INSERT OR IGNORE INTO People (name, retrieved)
    VALUES ( ?, 0)''', ( friend, ) )
</input>
    </program>
    <p>We add the <c>OR IGNORE</c> clause to our <c>INSERT</c>
                statement to indicate that if this particular <c>INSERT</c> would
                cause a violation of the <q><c>name</c> must be unique</q> rule, the
                database system is allowed to ignore the <c>INSERT</c>. We are
                using the database constraint as a safety net to make sure we don't
                inadvertently do something incorrect.</p>
    <p>Similarly, the following code ensures that we don't add the exact same
                <c>Follows</c> relationship twice.</p>
    <program language="python">
      <input>
cur.execute('''INSERT OR IGNORE INTO Follows
    (from_id, to_id) VALUES (?, ?)''', (id, friend_id) )
</input>
    </program>
    <p>Again, we simply tell the database to ignore our attempted
                <c>INSERT</c> if it would violate the uniqueness constraint that
                we specified for the <c>Follows</c> rows.</p>

  <subsection xml:id="database_retrieve-and-or-insert-a-record">
    <title>Retrieve and/or insert a record</title>
    <p>When we prompt the user for a Twitter account, if the account exists, we
                must look up its <c>id</c> value. If the account does not yet
                exist in the <c>People</c> table, we must insert the record and
                get the <c>id</c> value from the inserted row.</p>
    <p>This is a very common pattern and is done twice in the program above.
                This code shows how we look up the <c>id</c> for a friend's
                account when we have extracted a <c>screen_name</c> from a <c>user</c>
                node in the retrieved Twitter JSON.</p>
    <p>Since over time it will be increasingly likely that the account will
                already be in the database, we first check to see if the
                <c>People</c> record exists using a <c>SELECT</c> statement.</p>
              <p>If all goes well <fn>In general, when a sentence starts with “if all goes well”, you will find that
                    the code needs to use try/except.</fn> inside
                the <c>try</c> section, we retrieve
                the record using <c>fetchone()</c> and then retrieve the first
                (and only) element of the returned tuple and store it in <c>friend_id</c>.</p>
    <p>If the <c>SELECT</c> fails, the <c>fetchone()[0]</c> code
                will fail and control will transfer into the <c>except</c>
                section.</p>
    <program language="python">
      <input>
friend = api.get_user(user_id=currId)
screenName = friend.screen_name

# get the key for this screen name
cur.execute('SELECT id FROM People WHERE name = ? LIMIT 1',
            (screenName, ))

# if found it then add one to count old
try:
    friend_id = cur.fetchone()[0]
    countold = countold + 1

# if didn't find it insert it
except:
    cur.execute('''INSERT OR IGNORE INTO People (name, retrieved)
                VALUES (?, 0)''', (screenName, ))

        print('Error inserting account:', screenName)
        continue
    friend_id = cur.lastrowid
    countnew = countnew + 1
</input>
    </program>
    <p>If we end up in the <c>except</c> code, it simply means that the
                row was not found, so we must insert the row. We use <c>INSERT OR
IGNORE</c> just to avoid errors and then call <c>conn.commit()</c>
                to force the database to really be updated. After the write is done, we
                can check the <c>cur.rowcount</c> to see how many rows were
                affected. Since we are attempting to insert a single row, if the number
                of affected rows is something other than 1, it is an error.</p>
    <p>If the <c>INSERT</c> is successful, we can look at
                <c>cur.lastrowid</c> to find out what value the database assigned
                to the <c>id</c> column in our newly created row.</p>

  <subsection xml:id="database_storing-the-friend-relationship">
    <title>Storing the friend relationship</title>
    <p>Once we know the key value for both the Twitter user and the friend in
                the JSON, it is a simple matter to insert the two numbers into the
                <c>Follows</c> table with the following code:</p>
    <program language="python">
      <input>
cur.execute('''INSERT OR IGNORE INTO Follows (from_id, to_id)
               VALUES (?, ?)''', (id, friend_id))
</input>
    </program>
    <p>Notice that we let the database take care of keeping us from
                <q>double-inserting</q> a relationship by creating the table with a
                uniqueness constraint and then adding <c>OR IGNORE</c> to our
                <c>INSERT</c> statement.</p>
    <p>Here is a sample execution of this program:</p>
    <pre>Enter a Twitter screen name, or hit enter, or type quit: drchuck
Retrieving account drchuck
New accounts= 5  revisited= 0
Enter a Twitter screen name, or hit enter, or type quit:
Retrieving account ravenmaster1
New accounts= 5  revisited= 0
Enter a Twitter screen name, or hit enter, or type quit:
Retrieving account BrentSeverance
New accounts= 4  revisited= 1
Enter a Twitter screen name, or hit enter, or type quit: quit</pre>
    <p>We started with the <c>drchuck</c> account and then let the
                program automatically use the next two accounts to retrieve and add to
                our database.</p>
    <p>The following is the first few rows in the <c>People</c> and
                <c>Follows</c> tables after this run is completed:</p>
    <pre>People:
People:
(1, 'drchuck', 1)
(2, 'ravenmaster1', 1)
(3, 'BrentSeverance', 1)
(4, 'prairycat', 0)
(5, 'lionelrobertjr', 0)
...
15 rows.
Follows:
(1, 2)
(1, 3)
(1, 4)
(1, 5)
(1, 6)
...
15 rows.</pre>
    <p>You can see the <c>id</c>, <c>name</c>, and
                <c>visited</c> fields in the <c>People</c> table and you see
                the numbers of both ends of the relationship in the <c>Follows</c>
                table. In the <c>People</c> table, we can see that the first three
                people have been visited and their data has been retrieved. The data in
                the <c>Follows</c> table indicates that <c>drchuck</c> (user
                1) is a friend to all of the people shown in the first five rows. This
                makes sense because the first data we retrieved and stored was the
                Twitter friends of <c>drchuck</c>. If you were to print more rows
                from the <c>Follows</c> table, you would see the friends of users
                2 and 3 as well.</p>
