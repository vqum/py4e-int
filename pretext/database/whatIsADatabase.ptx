  <p>A <em>database</em> is a file that is organized for storing
            data. Most databases are organized like a dictionary in the sense that
            they map from keys to values. The biggest difference is that the
            database is on disk (or other permanent storage), so it persists after
            the program ends. Because a database is stored on permanent storage, it
            can store far more data than a dictionary, which is limited to the size
            of the memory in the computer.</p>
  <p>Like a dictionary, database software is designed to keep the inserting
            and accessing of data very fast, even for large amounts of data.
            Database software maintains its performance by building
            <em>indexes</em> as data is added to the database to allow the
            computer to jump quickly to a particular entry.</p>
  <p>There are many different database systems which are used for a wide
            variety of purposes including: Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server,
            PostgreSQL, and SQLite. We focus on SQLite in this book because it is a
            very common database and is already built into Python. SQLite is
            designed to be <em>embedded</em> into other applications to provide database
            support within the application. For example, the Firefox browser also
            uses the SQLite database internally as do many other products.</p>

  </p>
  <p>SQLite is well suited to some of the data manipulation problems that we
            see in Informatics such as the Twitter spidering application that we
            describe in this chapter.</p>
