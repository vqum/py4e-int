  <p>The real power of a relational database is when we create multiple
            tables and make links between those tables. The act of deciding how to
            break up your application data into multiple tables and establishing the
            relationships between the tables is called <em>data
                modeling</em>. The design document that shows the tables and their
            relationships is called a <em>data model</em>.</p>
  <p>Data modeling is a relatively sophisticated skill and we will only
            introduce the most basic concepts of relational data modeling in this
            section. For more detail on data modeling you can start with:</p>

  <p>Let's say for our Twitter spider application, instead of just counting a
            person's friends, we wanted to keep a list of all of the incoming
            relationships so we could find a list of everyone who is following a
            particular account.</p>
  <p>Since everyone will potentially have many accounts that follow them, we
            cannot simply add a single column to our <c>Twitter</c> table. So
            we create a new table that keeps track of pairs of friends. The
            following is a simple way of making such a table:</p>
  <program language="{.sql}">
    <input>
CREATE TABLE Pals (from_friend TEXT, to_friend TEXT)
</input>
  </program>
  <p>Each time we encounter a person who <c>drchuck</c> is following,
            we would insert a row of the form:</p>
  <program language="{.sql}">
    <input>
INSERT INTO Pals (from_friend,to_friend) VALUES ('drchuck', 'lhawthorn')
</input>
  </program>
  <p>As we are processing the 20 friends from the <c>drchuck</c> Twitter feed, we will
            insert 20 records with <q>drchuck</q> as the first parameter so we will end up duplicating
            the string many times in the database.</p>
  <p>This duplication of string data violates one of the best practices for
            <em>database normalization</em> which basically states that we
            should never put the same string data in the database more than once. If
            we need the data more than once, we create a numeric
            <em>key</em> for the data and reference the actual data using
            this key.</p>

  <p>In practical terms, a string takes up a lot more space than an integer
            on the disk and in the memory of our computer, and takes more processor
            time to compare and sort. If we only have a few hundred entries, the
            storage and processor time hardly matters. But if we have a million
            people in our database and a possibility of 100 million friend links, it
            is important to be able to scan data as quickly as possible.</p>
  <p>We will store our Twitter accounts in a table named <c>People</c>
            instead of the <c>Twitter</c> table used in the previous example.
            The <c>People</c> table has an additional column to store the
            numeric key associated with the row for this Twitter user. SQLite has a
            feature that automatically adds the key value for any row we insert into
            a table using a special type of data column (<c>INTEGER PRIMARY
KEY</c>).</p>
  <p>We can create the <c>People</c> table with this additional
            <c>id</c> column as follows:</p>
  <program language="{.sql}">
    <input>
CREATE TABLE People
    (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT UNIQUE, retrieved INTEGER)
</input>
  </program>
  <p>Notice that we are no longer maintaining a friend count in each row of
            the <c>People</c> table. When we select <c>INTEGER PRIMARY
KEY</c> as the type of our <c>id</c> column, we are indicating
            that we would like SQLite to manage this column and assign a unique
            numeric key to each row we insert automatically. We also add the keyword
            <c>UNIQUE</c> to indicate that we will not allow SQLite to insert
            two rows with the same value for <c>name</c>.</p>
  <p>Now instead of creating the table <c>Pals</c> above, we create a
            table called <c>Follows</c> with two integer columns <c>from_id</c> and
            <c>to_id</c> and a constraint on the table that the <em>combination</em> of
            <c>from_id</c> and <c>to_id</c> must be unique in this table (i.e., we cannot
            insert duplicate rows) in our database.</p>
  <program language="{.sql}">
    <input>
CREATE TABLE Follows
    (from_id INTEGER, to_id INTEGER, UNIQUE(from_id, to_id) )
</input>
  </program>
  <p>When we add <c>UNIQUE</c> clauses to our tables, we are
            communicating a set of rules that we are asking the database to enforce
            when we attempt to insert records. We are creating these rules as a
            convenience in our programs, as we will see in a moment. The rules both
            keep us from making mistakes and make it simpler to write some of our
            code.</p>
  <p>In essence, in creating this <c>Follows</c> table, we are
            modelling a <q>relationship</q> where one person <q>follows</q> someone else and
            representing it with a pair of numbers indicating that (a) the people
            are connected and (b) the direction of the relationship.</p>
