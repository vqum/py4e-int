      <title>The strange history of <q>Think Python</q></title>
      <p>(Allen B. Downey)</p>
      <p>In January 1999 I was preparing to teach an introductory programming
                    class in Java. I had taught it three times and I was getting frustrated.
                    The failure rate in the class was too high and, even for students who
                    succeeded, the overall level of achievement was too low.</p>
      <p>One of the problems I saw was the books. They were too big, with too
                    much unnecessary detail about Java, and not enough high-level guidance
                    about how to program. And they all suffered from the trap door effect:
                    they would start out easy, proceed gradually, and then somewhere around
                    Chapter 5 the bottom would fall out. The students would get too much new
                    material, too fast, and I would spend the rest of the semester picking
                    up the pieces.</p>
      <p>Two weeks before the first day of classes, I decided to write my own
                    book. My goals were:</p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Keep it short. It is better for students to read 10 pages than not
                            read 50 pages.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Be careful with vocabulary. I tried to minimize the jargon and
                            define each term at first use.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Build gradually. To avoid trap doors, I took the most difficult
                            topics and split them into a series of small steps.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Focus on programming, not the programming language. I included the
                            minimum useful subset of Java and left out the rest.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>I needed a title, so on a whim I chose <em>How to Think Like a Computer
                        Scientist</em>.</p>
      <p>My first version was rough, but it worked. Students did the reading, and
                    they understood enough that I could spend class time on the hard topics,
                    the interesting topics and (most important) letting the students
                    practice.</p>
                  <p><idx>GNU Free Documentation License</idx>
    <idx>Free Documentation License, GNU</idx>I released the book under the GNU Free Documentation License,<idx>GNU Free Documentation License</idx><idx><h>Free Documentation License</h><h>GNU</h></idx> which
                    allows users to copy, modify, and distribute the book.</p>
      <p>What happened next is the cool part. Jeff Elkner, a high school teacher
                    in Virginia, adopted my book and translated it into Python. He sent me a
                    copy of his translation, and I had the unusual experience of learning
                    Python by reading my own book.</p>
      <p>Jeff and I revised the book, incorporated a case study by Chris Meyers,
                    and in 2001 we released <em>How to Think Like a Computer Scientist:
                        Learning with Python</em> , also under the GNU Free Documentation License. As
                    Green Tea Press, I published the book and started selling hard copies
                    through Amazon.com and college book stores. Other books from Green Tea
                    Press are available at <url href="greenteapress.com" visual="greenteapress.com">greenteapress.com</url>.</p>
      <p>In 2003 I started teaching at Olin College and I got to teach Python for
                    the first time. The contrast with Java was striking. Students struggled
                    less, learned more, worked on more interesting projects, and generally
                    had a lot more fun.</p>
      <p>Over the last five years I have continued to develop the book,
                    correcting errors, improving some of the examples and adding material,
                    especially exercises. In 2008 I started work on a major revision&#x2014;at the
                    same time, I was contacted by an editor at Cambridge University Press
                    who was interested in publishing the next edition. Good timing!</p>
      <p>I hope you enjoy working with this book, and that it helps you learn to
                    program and think, at least a little bit, like a computer scientist.</p>

      <title>Acknowledgements for <q>Think Python</q></title>
      <p>(Allen B. Downey)</p>
      <p>First and most importantly, I thank Jeff Elkner, who translated my Java
                    book into Python, which got this project started and introduced me to
                    what has turned out to be my favorite language.</p>
      <p>I also thank Chris Meyers, who contributed several sections to <em>How to
                        Think Like a Computer Scientist</em>.</p>
      <p><idx>GNU Free Documentation License</idx>
    <idx>Free Documentation License, GNU</idx>And I thank the Free Software Foundation for developing the GNU Free
                    Documentation License, which helped make my collaboration with Jeff and
                    Chris possible.</p>
      <p>I also thank the editors at Lulu who worked on <em>How to Think Like a
                        Computer Scientist</em>.</p>
      <p>I thank all the students who worked with earlier versions of this book
                    and all the contributors (listed in an Appendix) who sent in corrections
                    and suggestions.</p>
      <p>And I thank my wife, Lisa, for her work on this book, and Green Tea
                    Press, and everything else, too.</p>
