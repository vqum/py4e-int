  <p>So far we have been learning the Python language and then learning how
            to use Python, the network, and databases to manipulate data.</p>
  <p>In this chapter, we take a look at three complete applications that
            bring all of these things together to manage and visualize data. You
            might use these applications as sample code to help get you started in
            solving a real-world problem.</p>
  <p>Each of the applications is a ZIP file that you can download and extract
            onto your computer and execute.</p>
