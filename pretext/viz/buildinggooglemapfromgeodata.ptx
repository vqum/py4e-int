  <title>Building a Google map from geocoded data</title>
  <warning>
    <p>The Google API requires an account created with a credit card number, though it is free to use up to a certain number of requests.</p>
  </warning>
  <p>In this project, we are using the Google geocoding API to clean up some
            user-entered geographic locations of university names and then placing
            the data on a Google map.</p>
  <image source="images/google-map.png" width="50%" alt="A Google map"/>
  <p>To get started, download the application from:</p>
  <p>
    <url href="http://www.py4e.com/code3/geodata.zip" visual="http://www.py4e.com/code3/geodata.zip">www.py4e.com/code3/geodata.zip</url>
  </p>
  <p>The first problem to solve is that the free Google geocoding API is
            rate-limited to a certain number of requests per day. If you have a lot
            of data, you might need to stop and restart the lookup process several
            times. So we break the problem into two phases.</p>

  <p>In the first phase we take our input <q>survey</q> data in the file
            <em>where.data</em> and read it one line at a time, and retrieve
            the geocoded information from Google and store it in a database
            <em>geodata.sqlite</em>. Before we use the geocoding API for
            each user-entered location, we simply check to see if we already have
            the data for that particular line of input. The database is functioning
            as a local <q>cache</q> of our geocoding data to make sure we never ask
            Google for the same data twice.</p>

  <p>You can restart the process at any time by removing the file
            <em>geodata.sqlite</em>.</p>
  <p>Run the <em>geoload.py</em> program. This program will read the
            input lines in <em>where.data</em> and for each line check to
            see if it is already in the database. If we don't have the data for the
            location, it will call the geocoding API to retrieve the data and store
            it in the database.</p>
  <p>Here is a sample run after there is already some data in the database:</p>
  <pre>Found in database  Northeastern University
Found in database  University of Hong Kong, ...
Found in database  Technion
Found in database  Viswakarma Institute, Pune, India

  <p>The first five locations are already in the database and so they are
            skipped. The program scans to the point where it finds new locations and
            starts retrieving them.</p>
  <p>The <em>geoload.py</em> program can be stopped at any time, and
            there is a counter that you can use to limit the number of calls to the
            geocoding API for each run. Given that the <em>where.data</em>
            only has a few hundred data items, you should not run into the daily
            rate limit, but if you had more data it might take several runs over
            several days to get your database to have all of the geocoded data for
            your input.</p>

  <p>Once you have some data loaded into <em>geodata.sqlite</em>, you
            can visualize the data using the <em>geodump.py</em> program.
            This program reads the database and writes the file
            <em>where.js</em> with the location, latitude, and longitude in
            the form of executable JavaScript code.</p>
  <p>A run of the <em>geodump.py</em> program is as follows:</p>
  <pre>Northeastern University, ... Boston, MA 02115, USA 42.3396998 -71.08975
Bradley University, 1501 ... Peoria, IL 61625, USA 40.6963857 -89.6160811

Kokshetau, Kazakhstan 53.2833333 69.3833333
...
12 records written to where.js
Open where.html to view the data in a browser</pre>
  <p>The file <em>where.html</em> consists of HTML and JavaScript to
            visualize a Google map. It reads the most recent data in
            <em>where.js</em> to get the data to be visualized. Here is the
            format of the <em>where.js</em> file:</p>
  <program language="{.js}">
    <input>
myData = [
[42.3396998,-71.08975, 'Northeastern Uni ... Boston, MA 02115'],
[40.6963857,-89.6160811, 'Bradley University, ... Peoria, IL 61625, USA'],
[32.7775,35.0216667, 'Technion, Viazman 87, Kesalsaba, 32000, Israel'],
   ...
];
</input>
  </program>
  <p>This is a JavaScript variable that contains a list of lists. The syntax
            for JavaScript list constants is very similar to Python, so the syntax
            should be familiar to you.</p>
  <p>Simply open <em>where.html</em> in a browser to see the
            locations. You can hover over each map pin to find the location that the
            geocoding API returned for the user-entered input. If you cannot see any
            data when you open the <em>where.html</em> file, you might want
            to check the JavaScript or developer console for your browser.</p>
