  <p>Support for searching files using regular expressions was built into the
            Unix operating system since the 1960s and it is available in nearly all
            programming languages in one form or another.</p>
  <p>As a matter of fact, there is a command-line program built into Unix
            called <em>grep</em> (Generalized Regular Expression Parser)
            that does pretty much the same as the <c>search()</c> examples in
            this chapter. So if you have a Macintosh or Linux system, you can try
            the following commands in your command-line window.</p>
  <program language="{.bash}">
    <input>
$ grep '^From:' mbox-short.txt
From: stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za
From: louis@media.berkeley.edu
From: zqian@umich.edu
From: rjlowe@iupui.edu
</input>
  </program>
  <p>This tells <c>grep</c> to show you lines that start with the
            string <q>From:</q> in the file <em>mbox-short.txt</em>. If you
            experiment with the <c>grep</c> command a bit and read the
            documentation for <c>grep</c>, you will find some subtle
            differences between the regular expression support in Python and the
            regular expression support in <c>grep</c>. As an example,
            <c>grep</c> does not support the non-blank character
            <c>\S</c> so you will need to use the slightly more complex set
            notation <c>[^ ]</c>, which simply means match a character that is anything
            other than a space.</p>

      <p>11-9-1: Which option(s) properly uses the grep command-line to search for prices? Select all that apply.</p>

          <p>Correct! This is the correct way to use grep to find prices in a file.</p>

          <p>Correct! This uses the /d regex character to find prices in mbox-short.txt.</p>
