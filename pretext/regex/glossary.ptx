      <title>Brittle Code</title>
      <p>Code that works when the input data is in a particular format but is prone to breakage if there is some deviation from the correct format. We call this <q>brittle code</q> because it is easily broken.</p>

      <title>Greedy Matching</title>
      <p>The notion that the <c>+</c> and <c>*</c> characters in a regular expression expand outward to match the largest possible string.</p>

    <gi>
      <title>Grep</title>
      <p>A command available in most Unix systems that searches through text files looking for lines that match regular expressions. The command name stands for <q>Generalized Regular Expression Parser</q>.</p>

      <title>Regular Expression</title>
      <p>A language for expressing more complex search strings. A regular expression may contain special characters that indicate that a search only matches at the beginning or end of a line or many other similar capabilities.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>Wild Card</title>
      <p>A special character that matches any character. In regular expressions the wild-card character is the period.</p>
