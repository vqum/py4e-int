  <title>Please join a research study to help us test new approaches to learning programming!</title>
  <p>Hi! We are a team of researchers in Professor Ericson's Lab at UMSI!</p>
  <raw format="html" xml:space="preserve">&lt;h4&gt;The Project&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are invited to participate in a research study about how Parsons problems (a type of coding puzzle) may help
CS entry-level learning. You must be at least &lt;b&gt;18&lt;/b&gt; to participate. &lt;br&gt;
Your participation will help more students become successful in computing courses in a low-cost, scalable, and easily
adopted way. &lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt; What Will Occur &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study takes 50 minutes to one hour to finish. The study materials include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Knowledge Review - A basic knowledge review about &lt;b&gt;Python basics&lt;/b&gt; (~5 mins)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;System Introduction - Materials to get you familiar with the types of problems in this study (~5 mins)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Pre Survey - Questions about your level of programming self-efficacy (~5 mins)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Practice - Four code practice problems (~20 mins)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Posttest - A short posttest consists of 4 programming questions (~15 mins)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each section must be completed in order. After finishing one part, you can click the link provided under &lt;b&gt;"What to do next"&lt;/b&gt; to the next part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt; Confidentiality of Information &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the data we collect will be de-identified. We will not collect any identifiable data such as demographic information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Who to Contact&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt; If you have any questions about the study, please contact Xinying Hou at xyhou@umich.edu
with <q>[Parsons Problem Study]</q> included in the email subject. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We greatly appreciate your help!&lt;/p&gt;</raw>
