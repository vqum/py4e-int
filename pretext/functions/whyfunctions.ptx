  <p>It may not be clear why it is worth the trouble to divide a program into
            functions. There are several reasons:</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Creating a new function gives you an opportunity to name a group of
                    statements, which makes your program easier to read, understand, and
                    debug.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Functions can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code.
                    Later, if you make a change, you only have to make it in one place.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Dividing a long program into functions allows you to debug the parts
                    one at a time and then assemble them into a working whole.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Well-designed functions are often useful for many programs. Once you
                    write and debug one, you can reuse it.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>Part of the skill of creating and using functions is to have a function
            properly capture an idea, so throughout the rest of the book, we will
            often use a function definition to explain a concept. For example, later,
            we will show you code that finds the smallest value in a list of values
            and we will present it to you as a function named <c>min</c>, which takes a
            list of values as its argument and returns the list's smallest value.</p>
