  <p>It is quite common that you need an API key to make use of a
            vendor's API. The general idea is that they want to know who is using
            their services and how much each user is using. Perhaps they have free
            and pay tiers of their services or have a policy that limits the number
            of requests that a single individual can make during a particular time
            period.</p>
  <p>Sometimes once you get your API key, you simply include the key as part
            of POST data or perhaps as a parameter on the URL when calling the API.</p>

  <p>Other times, the vendor wants increased assurance of the source of the
            requests and so they expect you to send cryptographically signed
            messages using shared keys and secrets. A very common technology that is
            used to sign requests over the Internet is called
            <em>OAuth</em>. You can read more about the OAuth protocol at
            <url href="http://www.oauth.net" visual="http://www.oauth.net">www.oauth.net</url>.</p>
  <p>Thankfully there are a number of convenient
            and free OAuth libraries so you can avoid writing an OAuth
            implementation from scratch by reading the specification. These
            libraries are of varying complexity and have varying degrees of
            richness. The OAuth web site has information about various OAuth
            libraries.</p>
