        <p>It is best to use a POGIL approach with the following. In POGIL students work
            in groups on activities and each member has an assigned role.  For more information see <url href="https://cspogil.org/Home" visual="https://cspogil.org/Home">https://cspogil.org/Home</url>.</p>
        <note>
            <p>If you work in a group, have only one member of the group fill in the answers on this page.  You will be able to share your answers with the group at the bottom of the page.</p>
        </note>
        <p>Many interesting problems involve manipulating sequences of data.
            You've learned about strings before, but this activity
            provides a more in-depth look at what they can do.</p>

            <p>A string is a sequence of characters in single quotes(') or double
                quotes ("). Depending on the application, we can treat a string as
                a single value (e.g., <c>sentence</c>), or we can access individual
                characters using square brackets (e.g., <c>sentence[0]</c>). We can also
                use <term>slice notation</term> (e.g., <c>sentece[4:8]</c>) to refer to a range of
                characters. In fact, all types of sequences (including <c>list</c>
                and <c>tuple</c>) support indexing and slicing.</p>

            <p>Let's take a look at how the <c>:</c> operator works for slicing
                a string. Consider the example <c>sentence[m:n]</c>. The value at
                <c>m</c> is the first character in the slice. It is the same value
                as <c>sentence[m]</c>. However, the value at <c>n</c> is not the same
                value as <c>sentence[n]</c>. <c>n</c> is the index <em>after</em> the last
                character included in the slice.</p>
            <p>You can also reference only a single number when creating a
                slice. The slice <c>[m:]</c> means <q>from the index <c>m</c> to the
                end.</q> The slice <c>[:n]</c> means <q>from the beginning to the index
                just before <c>n</c></q> (i.e., the first <c>n</c> characters).</p>
