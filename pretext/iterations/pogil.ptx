  <title>Group Work - Loops (For, Range, While)</title>
  <introduction>
  <p>It is best to use a POGIL approach with the following. In POGIL students work
            in groups on activities and each member has an assigned role.  For more information see <url href="https://cspogil.org/Home" visual="https://cspogil.org/Home">https://cspogil.org/Home</url>.</p>
  <note>
    <p>If you work in a group, have only one member of the group fill in the answers on this page.  You will be able to share your answers with the group at the bottom of the page.</p>
  </note>
  <p>A loop allows you to execute the same statements multiple times. Python has two
            kinds of loop structures: <c>for</c> loops, which iterate over the items of a
            sequence, and <c>while</c> loops, which continue to execute as long as a condition is true.</p>

    <p>In general, the length of the list determines the number of times that the loop repeats.
                The value of the variable <c>x</c> is selected from the list. Each time the loop runs, the
                next value from the list is assigned to <c>x</c>.</p>
    <p>Before your <c>for</c> statement, you can assign your list to a variable and your program
                will run the same way:</p>
    <exercise label="loops_ac_pogil_assigninglist">
      <statement>
        <p>Run this code to see what it prints.</p>
      </statement>
      <program xml:id="loops_ac_pogil_assigninglist_editor" interactive="activecode" language="python">
        <input>
print("hello")
numbers = [2, 7, 1]
for x in numbers:
    print("the number is", x)
print("goodbye")
        </input>
      </program>
    </exercise>
    <p>In addition, <c>for</c> loops can be used with strings:</p>
    <exercise label="loops_ac_pogil_string">
      <statement>
        <p>Run this code to see what it prints.</p>
      </statement>
      <program xml:id="loops_ac_pogil_string_editor" interactive="activecode" language="python">
        <input>
for c in "Hi!":
    print(c)
        </input>
      </program>
    </exercise>
    <p>With strings, a <c>for</c> statement iterates over each character in the string.
                The length of the string determines how many times the body of the loop will run.</p>
    <p><c>for</c> loops can also handle many other data types, like tuples and dictionaries.
                Experiment on your own to see this in action!</p>

        <p>Q-16: What must the value of the Boolean expression (after the <c>while</c>) be in order

    <p>In the above code, the variable <c>i</c> is incremented by 1 each time the loop body
                is executed. Because the value of <c>i</c> steadily grows, the <q>loop condition</q> (the
                Boolean expression after the <c>while</c>) eventually becomes false when i = 3, which
                causes the loop body to stop executing.</p>

    <p>A <c>while</c> loop has three parts that control the number of times it executes.
                The first part initializes the variable or condition, the second part tests
                whether the end has been reached, and the third part updates the variable or
                condition.</p>

    <p>When writing a <c>while</c> loop, it's helpful to answer a few
                questions before you start:</p>
    <p>
      <em>What needs to be initialized before the loop?</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>What condition must be true for the loop to repeat?</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>What will change so that the loop eventually ends?</em>
    </p>
    <p>For example, consider the code below. The <c>add(n)</c> function
                prompts the user for <c>n</c> numbers and returns the sum of these
                values. For example, when <c>add(5)</c> is called, the user is
                asked to input five numbers. If the user inputs 3, 1, 5, 2, and
                4, the function would return the value 15.</p>
    <exercise label="loops_ac_pogil_output_addn">
      <statement>
        <p>Observe the behavior of this code to see how it answers the the three bullet points above.</p>
      </statement>
      <program xml:id="loops_ac_pogil_output_addn_editor" interactive="activecode" language="python">
        <input>
def add(n):
    i = 0
    total = 0
    while i &lt; n:
        total = total + int(input('Enter a value:'))
        i = i + 1
    print(total)

add(5)
        </input>
      </program>
    </exercise>
    <p>Before the loop begins, the <c>i</c> variable, which counts how many
                times the loop runs, must be initialized. However, the <c>total</c>
                variable must also be initialized outside of the <c>while</c> loop,
                or else it would reset to 0 each time the loop ran.</p>
    <p>The loop repeats <c>n</c> times, so the Boolean expression that must
                be true for the loop to continue is <c>i &lt; n</c>.</p>
    <p>Finally, for the loop to eventually end, <c>i</c> must be incremented,
                so we include the statement <c>i = i + 1</c>.</p>
    <p>Making sure you answer these questions helps you write better
                (and less buggy) <c>while</c> loops.</p>
