        <p>Computers are often used to automate repetitive tasks. Repeating
            identical or similar tasks without making errors is something that
            computers do well and people do poorly. Because iteration is so common,
            Python provides several language features to make it easier.</p>
        <p>One form of iteration in Python is the <c>while</c> statement.
            Here is a simple program that counts down from five and then says
            <q>Blastoff!</q>.</p>

<program xml:id="codelens511" interactive="codelens" language="python">
    <input>
n = 5
while n &gt; 0:
    print(n)
    n = n - 1
print('Blastoff!')
    </input>
</program>
        <p>You can almost read the <c>while</c> statement as if it were
            English. It means, <q>While <c>n</c> is greater than 0, display the
            value of <c>n</c> and then reduce the value of <c>n</c> by 1. When you get
            to 0, exit the <c>while</c> statement and display the word <c>Blastoff!</c></q></p>

        <p>Q-2: Consider the code block below. What happens when you run this program?</p>
        <program language="python"><input>
n = 5
while n &gt; 0:
    print(n)
    n = n + 1
print('Blastoff!')
</input></program>

                    <p>Incorrect! The program both prints things and has more than five iterations. Try again.</p>

                <feedback>
                    <p>Correct! Because the loop is incrementing, rather than decrementing, n will always be greater than 0 and the loop will never end.</p>

        <p>More formally, here is the flow of execution for a <c>while</c>
            statement:</p>
        <p><ol marker="1">
            <li>
                <p>Evaluate the condition, yielding <c>True</c> or
                    <c>False</c>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the condition is false, exit the <c>while</c> statement and
                    continue execution at the next statement.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the condition is true, execute the body and then go back to
                    step 1.</p>
            </li>
        </ol></p>
        <p>This type of flow is called a <em>loop</em> because the third
            step loops back around to the top. We call each time we execute the body
            of the loop an <em>iteration</em>. For the above loop, we would
            say, <q>It had five iterations</q>, which means that the body of the loop was
            executed five times.</p>

        <exercise label="itWhile_fill1">
            <statement>
    <p>Q-3: We call each time we execute the body of the loop an ________. <var/>  </p></statement><setup><var><condition string="[Ii]teration"><feedback><p>Each time we execute the body of a loop, we are completing an iteration.</p></feedback></condition><condition string=".*"><feedback><p>Incorrect! Read the text above this to find the answer. Try again!</p></feedback></condition></var></setup></exercise>        <p>The body of the loop should change the value of one or more variables so
            that eventually the condition becomes false and the loop terminates. We
            call the variable that changes each time the loop executes and controls
            when the loop finishes the <em>iteration variable</em>. If there
            is no iteration variable, the loop will repeat forever, resulting in an
            <em>infinite loop</em>.</p>

        <p>Q-4: Consider the code block below. What are the values of x and y when this while loop finishes executing?</p>
        <program language="python"><input>

                </statement>
                <feedback>
                    <p>Incorrect! These were the values of x and y at first, but they changed by the time the loop finished executing. Try again.</p>

            <choice>

                <feedback>
                    <p>Incorrect! The while loop will finish executing before x and y reach these values. Try again.</p>

                <feedback>
                    <p>Correct! The loop will terminate at x = 4 and y = 3 because at this point, x is not less than y.</p>

                <feedback>
                    <p>Incorrect! The way the loop modifies x and y, it is impossible for y to be 2 while x is 4. Try again.</p>
