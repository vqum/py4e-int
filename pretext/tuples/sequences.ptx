  <p>I have focused on lists of tuples, but almost all of the examples in
            this chapter also work with lists of lists, tuples of tuples, and tuples
            of lists. To avoid enumerating the possible combinations, it is
            sometimes easier to talk about sequences of sequences.</p>
  <p>In many contexts, the different kinds of sequences (strings, lists, and
            tuples) can be used interchangeably. So how and why do you choose one
            over the others?</p>
  <p>To start with the obvious, strings are more limited than other sequences
            because the elements have to be characters. They are also (with the exception of lists) immutable. If
            you need the ability to change the characters in a string (as opposed to
            creating a new string), you might want to use a list of characters
            instead.</p>
  <p>Lists are more common than tuples, mostly because they are mutable. But
            there are a few cases where you might prefer tuples:</p>
  <p>In some contexts, like a <c>return</c> statement, it is syntactically simpler to create a tuple than a list. In other contexts, you might prefer a list.</p>
  <p>If you want to use a sequence as a dictionary key, you have to use an immutable type like a tuple or string.</p>
  <p>If you are passing a sequence as an argument to a function, using tuples reduces the potential for unexpected behavior due to aliasing.</p>

    <statement>
      <p>11-9-1: When using a sequence as a dictionary key, it is best to use a ______ because it is immutable. <var/>  </p>
    </statement>
    <setup>
      <var>
        <condition string="[Tt]uple">
          <feedback>
            <p>Correct! A tuple is perfect for this scenario. One could also use a string.</p>
          </feedback>
        </condition>
        <condition string=".*">
          <feedback>
            <p>Incorrect! Hint: what is this chapter about? Try again.</p>

  </exercise>
  <p>Because tuples are immutable, they don't provide methods like
            <c>sort</c> and <c>reverse</c>, which modify existing lists.
            However Python provides the built-in functions <c>sorted</c> and
            <c>reversed</c>, which take any sequence as a parameter and return
            a new sequence with the same elements in a different order.</p>
