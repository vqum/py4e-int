  <p>A text file can be thought of as a sequence of lines, much like a Python
            string can be thought of as a sequence of characters. For example, this
            is a sample of a text file which records mail activity from various
            individuals in an open source project development team:</p>

  <p>The entire file of mail interactions is available from</p>

  </p>
  <p>and a shortened version of the file is available from</p>

  <p>These files are in a standard format for a file containing multiple mail
            messages. The lines which start with <q>From </q> separate the messages and
            the lines which start with <q>From:</q> are part of the messages. For more
            information about the mbox format, see
            <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox" visual="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox</url>.</p>
  <p>To break the file into lines, there is a special character that
            represents the <q>end of the line</q> called the <em>newline</em>
            character.</p>
  <p>In Python, we represent the <em>newline</em> character as a
            backslash-n in string constants. Even though this looks like two
            characters, it is actually a single character. When we look at the
            variable by entering <q>stuff</q> in the interpreter, it shows us the <c>\n</c> in
            the string, but when we use <c>print</c> to show the string, we
            see the string broken into two lines by the newline character.</p>
  <program xml:id="fileNewLine" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
stuff = 'Hello World!'
print(stuff)
stuff = 'Hello\nWorld!'
print(stuff)
stuff = 'X\nY'
print(stuff)
len(stuff)
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>You can also see that the length of the string <c>X\nY</c> is <em>three</em>
            characters because the newline character is a single character.</p>
  <p>So when we look at the lines in a file, we need to remember that there
            is a special invisible character called the newline at the end of each
            line that marks the end of the line.</p>
  <p>So the newline character separates the characters in the file into
            lines.</p>
