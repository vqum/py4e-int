  <p>So far, we have learned how to write programs and communicate our
            intentions to the <em>Central Processing Unit</em> using
            conditional execution, functions, and iterations. We have learned how to
            create and use data structures in the <em>Main Memory</em>. The
            CPU and memory are where our software works and runs. It is where all of
            the <q>thinking</q> happens.</p>

  <p>But if you recall from our hardware architecture discussions, once the
            power is turned off, anything stored in either the CPU or main memory is
            erased. So up to now, our programs have just been transient fun
            exercises to learn Python.</p>

  <p>In this chapter, we start to work with <em>Secondary Memory</em>
            (or files). Secondary memory is not erased when the power is turned
            off. Or in the case of a USB flash drive, the data we write from our
            programs can be removed from the system and transported to another
            system.</p>
  <p>We will primarily focus on reading and writing text files such as those
            we create in a text editor. Later we will see how to work with database
            files which are binary files, specifically designed to be read and
            written through database software.</p>
