        .. tab:: Answer

            The ``capitalize()`` method returns a new string; it doesn't modify the original because strings are immutable. As a result, you need to assign the value of s1.capitalize() to s1.

        .. tab:: Answer

            The string slicing syntax in line 2 was incorrect. Remember, the final number in the slice is the index of the character after the final one you want in the string.

        .. tab:: Answer

            You can use the ``len()`` method to find the length of a string.

        Create a function named ``count`` that accepts a string and a letter
        as arguments, then returns the count of that letter in the string.
        For example, if the function call was ``count("banana", "a")`` it would
        return ``3``. *Hint: use the* ``count`` *method.*

                Take the following Python code that stores this string: ``string = "X-DSPAM-Confidence: 0.8475"``.

        .. tab:: Answer

            The ``float()`` function ignores whitespace, so you can begin the slice at the space character after the colon or at the 0 -- your choice!

        In Robert McCloskey's book *Make Way for Ducklings*, the names of the ducklings are
        Jack, Kack, Lack, Mack, Nack, Ouack, Pack, and Quack.
        The following loop tries to output these names in order.
        Of course, that's not quite right because Ouack and Quack are misspelled.
